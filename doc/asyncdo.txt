INTRODUCTION                                *asyncdo*

Simplest usable async runner for Vim and NeoVim. The reason for creating this
was that I needed something absurdly simple: run task in the background and
then populate |quickfix| window with result of such task (mostly running tests
in background).

COMMANDS                                   *asyncdo-commands*

                                           *:AsyncDo*
:AsyncDo[!] {cmd}      Run task in the background redirecting output to
                       temporary file that is loaded using |:cgetfile| after
                       task finishes.

                       This will not allow you to run 2 commands
                       simultaneously and will return with error message if
                       you try so.

                                           *:AsyncStop*
:AsyncStop             Stop currently running job using |job_stop()| or
                       |jobstop()| depending on your Vim implementation.

VARIABLES                                  *asyncdo-variables*

                                           *g:asyncdo_job*
Job ID of currently running task.


INTEGRATIONS                               *asyncdo-integrations*

                                           *asyncdo-integrations-statusline*
statusline ~

To display status of |:AsyncDo| in your statusline just check for existence of
|g:asyncdo_job|
>
    let &statusline .= "%{exists('g:asyncdo_job')?'runing':''}"
<

                                           *asyncdo-integrations-qf*
qf ~

|QuickFixCmdPost| is fired after job is finished, so auto opening
|quickfix-window| on finish is supported.

                                           *asyncdo-integrations-dispatch*
                                           *asyncdo-integrations-fugitive*
Dispatch ~

There is no collision between these two plugins, however for plugins using
dispatch plugin for async work (like Fugitive) you can add this in your |vimrc|
to use |:AsyncDo| instead:
>
        command! -bang -nargs=* Make exe 'AsyncDo<bang> '.&makefile.' <args>'
<

                                           *asyncdo-integrations-grep*
Async grep ~

Making |:grep| to run asynchronously is also quite trivial with:

>
        command! -bang -nargs=+ Make exe 'AsyncDo<bang> '.&grepprg.' <args>'
<
